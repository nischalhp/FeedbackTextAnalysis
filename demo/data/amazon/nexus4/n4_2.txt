The Nexus4 is priced at 49 for 16GB through Google's site. [...] The phones are ALL made un-locked (there is no locked version because there is no carrier associated). My husband put in his SIM card from his iphone and after about 20min it recognized his new device.

The phones are amazing. Very happy - but I just wanted to bring it to anyone looking at this listing, how overpriced this store is listing them.

We simply waited for the opportunity to get on backorder - and then three weeks after that we received our phones. It doesn't hurt to wait sometimes. The phone is worth it, and so is the money you will save.
