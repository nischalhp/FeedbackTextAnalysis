The Nokia Lumia 920 has all the practical use, solid quality, excellent performance, and extreme durability. Because NOKIA people wants to prove to the world that they are capable of produce the best phone to catch attention from consumers. That is why they try to put a lot of breakthrough technologies into one package. The NOKIA LUMIA 920 has many 1st in the world of smartphones. Here they are:
1. The 1st optical image stabilization with Carl Zeiss optics/ low light camera in a smartphone
2. The 1st super sensitive screen that can be used with glove in a smartphone
3. The 1st 60 fps screen refresh rate in a smartphone
4. The 1st wireless charging smartphone
5. The 1st Virtual reality City Lens. Hardware: A-gps + GLONASS (Seven years ago NOKIA introduced the world's first smartphone with GPS and navigation. Now, Nokia Lumia 920 and Nokia Lumia 820 are introducing the first autonomously assisted GPS and GLONASS receivers)
6. The 1st or one of the first 4G/ LTE supported ?
7. Maybe the 1st smartphone that you can throw against a concrete wall, and it still works (b/c of its Corning Gorilla Glass 2 and poly-carbonate body).
8. The clearest and loudest microphone/speaker of smartphones that I have been ever using.

What else: Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic, rich audio recording, Dolby stereo sound, luxury hot design award, Wifi N-dual band, free NOKIA maps, drive, and apps to travel the world, free virtual reality location City Lens, free NOKIA music... more.

This kind of phone don't come around very often (like NOKIA 808). Who knows perhaps in the next version, Nokia might not use some or all of the above technologies trying to make their phone much thinner and lighter.
