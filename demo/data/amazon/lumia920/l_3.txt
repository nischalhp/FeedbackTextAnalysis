Firstly, the Nokia Lumia 920 is the best phone that I have ever had/used, etc. and that is coming from an iphone user. It was time for a change when the iphone 5 underwhelmed and I am so happy to have considered Nokia, famous for making solid quality phones, with WP8.

Secondly, I know of the argument for choosing the other ecosystems and my response is simple. The phone does everything I need it to do and with features that blow away apple and Sammy in terms of complete user experience. I don't want 1M apps and the good apps will come to WP8 if they are not already there.

I didn't even mention value but once the phones are available with an AT&T package then the price per feature is just what the value buyer might be looking for. I got 3 of them (white, red, yellow) for family and one for my business manager. And all are incredibly happy with the performance and beauty of the phone.

Well done Nokia and thank you Amazon for selling them
