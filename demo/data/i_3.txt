Well, I do own an Iphone 5 and the product is great, however I tried to purchase this and the seller apparently went out of business, never refunded the money or let me know what was going on with my order. Amazon was awesome! I submitted a claim and got a full refund with no problems and very little effort in less than 2 days! So for a product review I do love this phone, I am partial to android but for my less tech savvy spouse this thing is great, phone calls, entertainment and the best way to keep from nagging at each other on long drives makes it a great addition to the family. Keeps her busy enough so she isn't verbally "assisting" my driving as much as normal. Also the blue tooth works perfect for streaming music to the stereo and hands free calling. As much as I am NOT an Apple fan form many reasons, this is a superb product if you don't need expandable storage or multiple tethering type options.
