FeedbackTextAnalysis
====================
Every Conference or hackathon we attend give out a feedback form end of the day.

It kinda sucks cause firstly its paper and secondly someone has to read it and enter it manually and then analyze it.

So to solve this , planning to create a web app which can be connected to a event and people can enter their feedback.

We can provide realtime analysis by performing some basic text analytics i.e Stemming , tagging , frequency count etc.

**Technologies used:**

* Python
* Flask
* Reading google forms output
* NLTK
* gspread
